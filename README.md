# PkgTplTutorial101

[![Build Status](https://github.com/doswellf/PkgTplTutorial101.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/doswellf/PkgTplTutorial101.jl/actions/workflows/CI.yml?query=branch%3Amain)

This is the README.md for my first PackageTemplates.jl tutorial package 

The hardest part was sync of the local package directory to my newly-created github repo PkgTplTutorial101.jl!
For some reason I ended up having to rebase and merge the local repo with my github repo after
creating the package with PackageTemplates t("PkgTplTutorial101") command!

This would be brutal for a novice user of git or of Julia! 
Perhaps an extra option in PackageTemplates.jl would be to have it automatically set up remote origin for the package.

But it was a great refresher on fixing git local <-> remote origin and merge issues!!!
